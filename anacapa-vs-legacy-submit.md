# Anacapa vs. Legacy Submit

* Uses Jenkins for running grading scripts (vs. custom code)
    * Off-the shelf, yum installable/updatable, open source free commodity software
    * Professional level support, security updates
    * logrotate built in (not true of legacy submit)
    * far more features than legacy submit
