## Forming Pairs/Groups

One of the protected items of student data is course enrollment, and as such, you cannot display who is or is not enrolled in a course. This proves to make forming pairs or groups difficult. To make this easier, we have added a "Discoverable" setting for users which they can "opt-in" to, which when enabled reveals their identity as part of the class to other classmates.
